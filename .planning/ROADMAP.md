# Roadmap: Anthropic Support for Sure

## Overview

Add native Anthropic Claude support as a first-class LLM provider in Sure. Users will be able to select between OpenAI and Anthropic through a settings UI dropdown, configure their API keys, and use all AI features (chat, auto-categorization, merchant detection) with their chosen provider. The implementation follows existing Sure patterns: Provider abstraction, registry pattern, and settings model with ENV fallbacks.

## Domain Expertise

None (Rails backend work following established patterns in the Sure codebase)

### Phase 9.1: Fix get_transactions function tool (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Fix "unknown attribute 'page' for Transaction::Search" error in AI chat function calling
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Research**: Unlikely (bug fixing)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 9.1-01: Handle symbol-keyed params from Anthropic in GetTransactions#call

**Status**: Complete (2026-01-10) - Fixed params.except to handle both string and symbol keys for order/page, ensuring compatibility with both OpenAI and Anthropic providers.

**Details:**
The AI chat was failing when calling the `get_transactions` function because Anthropic Claude passes `page` and `order` with symbol keys (not string keys like OpenAI). Fixed by updating `params.except("order", "page")` to `params.except("order", "page", :order, :page)` and using fallback pattern for params access.
