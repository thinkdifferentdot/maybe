# Phase 3: Chat Support - Context

**Gathered:** 2025-01-09
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

When users chat with the AI assistant using Anthropic's Claude, it should feel natural and thoughtful — like talking to a capable financial assistant rather than an API interface. The conversation flow should be smooth, with responses that feel more contextual and helpful for financial questions.

This is about leveraging Claude's strengths in natural conversation to give users a better experience when asking questions about their finances.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Natural conversation feel** — The user should feel like they're talking to a capable financial assistant, not an API interface. This is the core differentiator and the non-negotiable for this phase.

## What's Out of Scope

- **No voice/audio** — This is text-only chat. No AI voice features in this phase.
- **Tool calling** is still in scope (it's part of the phase), but the focus is on how natural the conversation feels, not just that tools work.
- **Streaming** may be deferred — the roadmap lists it as optional ("if feasible"). The natural feel matters more than streaming initially.

## Specific Ideas

- The user emphasized "natural conversation flow" over raw capabilities
- Claude's response quality should feel more thoughtful for financial conversations
- Tool calling is necessary (for fetching data, categorizing, etc.) but should feel seamless, not mechanical
- Multi-turn conversations matter — it's not just one-shot Q&A

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

The user chose "Enhanced Claude experience" over mirroring OpenAI exactly. This isn't about feature parity — it's about leveraging Claude's perceived strengths in natural conversation to create a better chat experience for Sure users.

The priority is conversation quality over streaming or other bells-and-whistles.
