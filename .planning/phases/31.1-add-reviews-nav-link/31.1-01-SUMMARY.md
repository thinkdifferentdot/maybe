# Phase 31.1 Plan 01: Add Reviews Link Summary

**Navigation menu item added to transactions page linking to AI reviews screen**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-18T19:30:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-18T19:33:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Added "Review AI suggestions" menu item to transactions page dropdown menu
- Menu item links to /transactions/reviews using transactions_reviews_path helper
- Used clipboard-check icon to visually represent review/feedback concept
- Added i18n key review_ai with value "Review AI suggestions"
- Menu properly localized using t(".review_ai") helper

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add reviews link to transactions menu** - `4f956e2c` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add i18n key for reviews link** - `e87e653a` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** `e72afd0b` (docs: create phase plan)

## Files Created/Modified
- `app/views/transactions/index.html.erb` - Added menu item linking to reviews page
- `config/locales/views/transactions/en.yml` - Added review_ai translation key

## Decisions Made

**Route helper correction:** During implementation, discovered the route helper is `transactions_reviews_path` not `reviews_path` due to the namespaced route definition (`namespace :transactions { resources :reviews ... }`). Used the correct helper.

**Icon selection:** Used `clipboard-check` icon to represent the review/feedback concept, matching the approve/reject functionality on the reviews page.

**Menu placement:** Placed after "Edit merchants" and before "Import" to group management-related items together.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written. Note: The plan mentioned `reviews_path` but the actual route helper is `transactions_reviews_path` due to namespacing - this is a documentation correction, not a deviation.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

- Reviews page accessible from transactions index menu
- i18n key added for consistency with other menu items
- Ready for Phase 32 (Accuracy Metrics)
